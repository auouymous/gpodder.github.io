title: Normalize Audio
---

Normalize the volume of audio files with [normalize-audio](http://normalize.nongnu.org/) (installed separately).
The Windows build of normalize-audio only contains the `normalize.exe` binary, which must be copied to `normalize-ogg.exe` and `normalize-mp3.exe`.
All three binaries must be in path for gPodder to find them.
