title: Rename episode after the download

Rename episodes to "&lt;Episode Title&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;" on download

Configuration options:

-   `add_sortdate` - If enabled, will add the sortdate of the episode (YYYY-MM-DD) at the front of the filename
-   `add_podcast_title` - If enabled, will add the podcast title at the front of the filename

If both `add_sortdate` and `add_podcast_title` are enabled, the sortdate will come before the episode (e.g. "`2015-09-29` `-` `Podcast` `Name` `-` `Episode` `Name.ext`").

The `Rename all downloaded episodes` item in the `Extras` menu will rename all currently downloaded episodes.
